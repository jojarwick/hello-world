## steps
-[ ] clone repo into ../project_x/
-[ ] check git status in ../project_x/repo_x/ using `git status`
-[ ] make sure working dir is clean and you are on the default git *master* branch `branch ls` to check
-[ ] the `master` branch is not to be worked on, because it's your only local copy, so create a copy of `master` using `git branch mylocalbranch` and `git branch checkout mylocalbranch` to switch to it
-[ ] make changes to your files in repo_x and when you are ready to save your changes you type `git add .` and `commit -m "Init repo";`
-[ ] when ready to push back to the repo from the `master` branch use `git merge mylocalbranch`
-[ ] finally push to github using `git push` as long as you have cloned from github.com your remote branch should be added to push up
